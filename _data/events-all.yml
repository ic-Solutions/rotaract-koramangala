                - This year our members decided to do something different for diwali and hence decided to celebrate it with kids.
                
                - Sneha Sadana is an orphanage for boys from the age of 5. We visited the orphanage and celebrated diwali with them by bursting crackers. The kids were very excited and so were our members and all had very good time and enjoyed the time spent there. We also had an opportunity to sponsor burgers and some sweets to the kids and authorities.
                
                - We had a discussion with them about the facilities and administrative aspects of the organisation which gave us a lot of insight about such trusts.

                - On the 1 st of December, 2013, our club organized a project called 'Bon Appetit'. It began with an introduction to rotaract by our president and secretary using a presentation. Since we had a number of prospective members that day, the purpose of the session was to motivate their participation and join the movement actively. Following the membership drive we had a communications and team building workshop by one of our own Rotaractor (NLP Coach) Rachel, who through activities analyzed the communication and team work patterns of each member present. This productive session ended with a potluck lunch where each member had either cooked a dish or bought something delicious to eat. It was truly a fun fellowship time with one another and a challenge to the taste buds as we gobbled dishes right from pulao to cupcakes and home-made salad. This was a project that proved to us that Rotaract can be both work and fun.

                - On the 19th of January, 2013, we awaited the arrival of the rotaractors form Mumbai eagerly as our club was hosting them for a mini sightseeing tour. Although quite tired after the polio drive, we welcomed them and even became quite excited about the fellowship time. Our first stop was at the Vishveshwaraya Museum. It was quite a hilarious time we had as we explored the items on display and clicked pictures of weighing machines claiming individuals to be overweight. Post a little phogography, we proceeded to UB city where we together marvelled at the structure and did quite a bit of window shopping. We exchanged information about ourselves, our city and ofcourse our clubs. It was a very interesting experience that resulted in new bonds.

Games that involved both the husband and wife were conducted that included paper dance, 'Does Romeo know Juliet' quiz, 'Follow your wife's voice' blindfolded and ' a mini scavenger hunt that made the participants run helter skelter and look for items and break clue codes. It was a fun-filled time that ended with a dinner together with them. A decision was made with the Rotarians to keep this as a tradition year after year with them.

Invited by the district to attend their conference. We had a fun filled journey by car to Chennai and were received warmly by the hosting club. After dining with them for breakfast, we were taken to the conference secretariat to interact with the conference committee, which was followed by lunch with the DRR, Rtr PHF Ram Kumar Raju. This was followed by an outing to the beach and a few other places for shopping in Chennai. In the night we were hosted for dinner by PDRR Rtr Solomon Victor and his club.
                
                - Day 2, we spent the day at the district conference where we witnessed amazing speakers who motivated us. It was a proud moment indeed when our member Rtr Rachel, a past member of 3230 was asked to speak on stage about her experience and participate in a session. In the night, we joined with Rotaract Club of Veppery, our hosts for their project along with Tree foundation, for a turtle walk. We had an orientation about the dangers they face by fishermen and toxic wastes. This was followed by a four hour midnight walk along the beach on Iminjikarai beach where we watched the little ones hatch, released them into the ocean. It was a once in a life time opportunity that the club let us share with them. We then had dinner with PDRR of 3230. Day 2 at the conference was equally stimulating and we were invited on stage for the IDYE presentation. Three of our rotaractors shared their experiences on stage. We then had letter -head and momento ex change with 5 clubs and the district. After a jam-packed 3 days, we returned to bangalore, tired but richer by a large number of friends, having experienced once again, true rotaraction knows no boundaries

                - On the 2nd of March, 2014, our club organized a community service project at Samarthana Trust, a school for orphans, physically and visually disabled children, age group between 6 to 12, situated at HSR layout. This project was the result of our first visit to Samarthana by our members who decided to initiate a clothes and stationery drive that ran a good length of two weeks. On the special day, we were joined by a troupe of 7 student clowns who put up an excellent show for the kids. Together we sang, danced with them, laughed at the mischievous tricks of theirs and awed at the balloon crafts they did. The show ran for around 2 hours much to the glee of the children who participated wholeheartedly. Following this, we conducted a drawing competition, where the most amazing experience was when we observed our members who were a little conserved, as they assisted a few children, held their hands, coloured for them and became heroes for a few kids in no time. It tugged at the heart to see the children draw motivational figures like Subash Chandra Bose and a few even idols of Gods and run to the members for acknowledgement. A few members even submitted their own drawings which truth be told was no match for the talent of some children. At the end of the evening with the children, we handed over a number of items to the management. 
                
                - The items were mostly collected from smaller drives initiated by our members at their respective work and study places. There was also a healthy contribution from the friends and families of our members. Some of these included notebooks, pencils, pens, erasers, scales, colour pencils, crayons and paints. Art and craft material was also provided. We also handed over new inner garments for all the children at the trust. Puzzles and toys were also given by our members in addition to food items such as health drinks, pickle, chocolates, cookies and biscuits. A first aid kit was also put together jointly by our members who contributed individually for the same. We all sat together in reflection following the event to share with one another what we had gained how we felt participating together to bring joy to the lives of these children. It was very insightful and we departed stronger at heart, feeling grateful for our bountiful life and for having the opportunity given by Rotaract to serve beyond self.

Later took them to Amoeba for bowling and gaming which turned out be the most fun time of the day. Lunched at Hotel Bheema's on Church street sharing ideas and projects of both the Districts. And we visited Vishveshwaraya museuum post lunch which took us more than 2hrs to complete the visit, but they had fun looking into all the amazing experiments. After a long and tiring day we got back home and had a small house party hosted by 6 of our club members with lots of entertainment, fun, exchanging ideas etc. On the 9th they spent the day at the conference.

Fellowship was the key word for the evening as we got to know each other better as well as joined hands to pay the atrocious bill that bore a hole deep into our pockets.

                - What’s the fun is celebrating a festival without good company?. On the 16th of March a few of our club members celebrated Holi along with rotaractors from Sheshadripuram and Peenya. It was one our first interaction with the others and turned out to be rotaraction at its best. Buckets of colored water were thrown at each other and atrocious combinations of colors were tried. We left looking like a bunch of multicoloured rags to another meeting.

                - On the 20th of April, Transform – a joint venture by RC Koramangala and RC Peenya was launched. The brain child of our club, this workshop was an effort to make certain basic life skills available for the public at a very affordable rate. The trainer was Ms. Rachel Jayaseelan, an NFNLP certified NLP Master Practitioner and Coach. The session was inaugurated by Rtn. Manivannan the president of our parent Rotary club. The workshop which ran the length of 5 hours, was jam packed with insightful facts, self awareness techniques, communication assessment skill training, videos and activities. Participants were trained to assess themselves as well as others on a number of concepts such as body cues, attention, rapport etc. The workshop received tremendously positive feedback that lead us to immediately launch the date of the second batch. What motivated us the most was the eagerness of the participants to learn and to improve themselves on certain domains. We had a total of 40 participants that included 2 EC members and a few DC members as well, with a majority being non Rotaractors. As a club we were even more happy to have a few enquire about joining our club as a result of this project.

                - With just two weeks to go from the previous transform batch, the team( RC Koramangala & RC Peenya) worked hard to complete the pre registration process. It turned out to be easier than we thought owing to the success of the previous workshop. The batch consisted of 30 participants with a majority again being non rotaractors, mostly prospective club members. With individuals from the age of 17 to 30, the trainer brilliantly delivered another well structured and interesting workshop that had the participants asking for more. We finished with a fellowship session with the new members already planning a third batch in the month of June.

                - This year began with a joint project with our Parent Rotary where we organized a clothes drive and they a health camp for construction workers at Nandi Citadel, Bannerghetta. We catered to more than 150 workers who were given a health check up which included dental hygiene and basic medicines were distributed. As Rotaractors we donated clothes for about 15 kids, 40 women and 102 men that we had collected across the period of two weeks. We also distributed sanitary napkins to the women and toys to the children. It was a joy to work with our parent Rotary and get to know them better. We also met with volunteers from T. John Institutions and motivated them to start a Rotaract Club. Well hope that works out!

The organizers shared with us some of the basic facts about the issue via story-telling and sing-a-along sessions. While Rtr. Harish cheered on the young ones with some of his usual clown antics, we also signed up as campaigners against child labour, met with the other volunteers and got to know more details such as helpline numbers and organizations to contact if the need be. We also viewed a lot of photographs about their lives taken by some of the rescued children themselves. We took a pledge to never turn our eye against child labour and ended the day with a good fellowship dinner along with one prospective member.

The release of the bulletin was done jointly by our IPP Rtr. Sourabh Chenni and President Rtr. Bharath. The bulletin also held a powerful message condemning violence against women and urging the public to protect their interests. It was indeed a proud moment for us, being the first bulletin of RCK

Following the completion of TRANSFORM and our bulletin release, a few of our members visited a temple near Ejipura slum and served food to the underprivileged there. It was a very humbling experience to serve another and receive heartfelt gratitude. Not only did the members serve the food, but some of them chose to eat with the children who ran over to our makeshift food counter. The day began with service and ended with service-truly a meaningful day

The kids were entertained by Rtr. Harish and his troupe of Compassionate Clowns who left them in peals of laughter which was indeed a sight to watch and appreciate. Food was then served to the children which was once again a very humbling experience. Post-lunch we were surprised to be joined by Rotaractors from Jayanagar, who had also chosen to spend the day with the children. Powered up, the afternoon was filled with activities like cricket, musical chairs, India quiz, cycling, and fondling some new born golden retriever pups. A huge cake was cut and distributed whereas the children’s and our own faces were painted in tri-color. The day ended with us making more friends within the Rotaract community and collaborated efforts to put a smile on a child.

On the day of the event, it was wonderful to see our members come together( in shift basis, due to Rotary Habba Duties), to MC, co-ordinate with transport and orphanages etc. All together it was a very satisfying experience to interact with these children, feed them and saying goodbye was the hardest. It was an opportunity for us to understand and learn about managing huge project, multi-tasking and working with a completely younger student age group. This project taught us patience and most importantly humility. It also helped us achieve our dream of organizing a large community project. A big thanks to all our members who helped raise funds a share in the joy of SMILE 2014.

Being a joint venture, the excitement was high as we awaited the arrival of the participants. Level- 1- workshop on communication skills and language of emotions- NLP based was conducted in the morning by Rtr. Rachel which was followed by a fellowship with our participants over lunch. The participants then returned for our Level-2 workshop, taken by Rtr. Sunil -a certified handwriting analyst. The two sessions were jam packed with enthusiasts who had either attended our previous workshops or brought by friends who had attended. Both trainers kept the sessions alive and interesting as more than 80 individuals proudly took home a certificate saying that they have been TRANSFORMED!!! Massive support by Rotaract Club of Surana and Mr. Sandeepani, the staff co-ordinator as the team lead by Rtr. Gulam assisted us through all our requirements.

                - Rotaract Club of Koramangala members had an orientation with 2 members of the LGBT community on 13-Oct-2014 at McDonald’s, Koramangala. Seven members of our club met with Ayaan and Jomin at 7 pm. After introductions, Ayaan and Jomin talked about their community and the ‘Pride’ event that’s scheduled in November. ‘Pride’ is a worldwide stance and movement of the LGBT community to fight for equal rights and justice. Pride parades and demonstrations occur every year. They emphasized on the fact that one’s sexuality is not a choice. There is still a lot of discrimination against them in the society. There are LGBT clubs like WHAQ (We are Here And Queer) and GRAB (Good As You). They have LGBT allies who support their cause. Support during the ‘Pride’ event and financial help are what they are looking for. Rotaractors informed them that our club will be an ally and can support them by taking part in the ‘Pride’ event which will be held in Bangalore on 23-Nov-2014. There will be several events such as Pride March, Garage Sale, Marathon, Diversity Fair, Freeze Mob, Queer Music etc. We also put forth the idea that representatives from the LGBT community can speak to the audience about their cause and experiences during Transform events or other meetings. They were happy about this. Details about helplines for people who want to come out about their sexuality was also discussed. We summed up by saying that we will help them in their fight. In turn they can participate in Rotaract events. Rotaract is looking forward to a wonderful and lasting collaboration with the LGBT community.The LGBT members were delighted by our support and amity and have expressed their gratitude. This session with them truly opened our eyes about their community, the issues they face and where we could pitch in to help. We were also amazed by their passion and show of emotional strength.

After a fun session of drama and creative brainstorming, the participants were taken to St. John’s hospital where under the encouragement of Rtr. Harish, they entertained children in the paediatric ward, complete with make-up and accessories. Following this, the participants were made to share their experiences, which was not only very emotional but also very inspirational.

More than 20 kgs of clothes had been collected across the period of a month, initiated by Rtr. Jatin. The rotaractors also spent time with the children and communicated with the home care-takers about their functioning and needs. It was also a very humbling experience to serve dinner to the children and sit down with them to eat. Taught us to be truly grateful for what we have. It was also very inspiring to see children with a variety of disabilities come together to pray and say grace before their meal.

Sharanya as part of our ongoing PROEJCT ECO BAG. It was amusing to see Rotaractors experiment with different types and sizes of bags. This was followed by a fellowship lunch at Chung Wahs, Koramangala. Our members pledged to make and donate a minimum of 1000 bags from our club. Plans were also made for joining hands with clubs across India for the same initiative, thus strengthening the cause.

The purpose of this was not only have a healthy competition between young poets but also to recognize and appreciate poetry writing as an art. While the PR for the event ran the length of 20 days, we were happy to receive very creative and meaningful entries from over 50 participants, both rotaractors and non-rotaractors as well. The theme decided for the poems was A social cause for the purpose of a future bulletin with some of the best entries.

                - On the 10th of January, 2015, the Rotaract Club of Koramangala hosted the IDYE team from Nepal. We first took them for a scrumptious meal of Pizza at the infamous Dominoes in Koramangala. Although we had to rush them quite a bit to gulp it down due to a project at 3 at St. John’s Hospital. The 5 members of the team joined Compassionate clowns and the members of RCK for an hour, entertaining children at the general wards at the hospital. It was a one of a kind experience for the whole team as we dressed them up and gave them the red noses and paint job to make them feel like true clowns. Post the clowning, we all gathered for a round of introduction and feedback about our experiences. It was touching to hear some of the accounts of the IDYE team who not only enjoyed it, but also were moved by the responses of the kids towards them. It was a proud moment indeed when they all appreciated Rtr. Harish Bhuvan and team for their initiative and vowed to get the module and take back the idea to their respective clubs.
                
                - We then proceeded to Atta Galatta, where we were joined by the team from RC Loyola Community. It was wonderful to see so many people from different cultures, interacting. The members were all asked to write a letter to someone, appreciating them or well just about anything.., and for it to be posted later. This wonderful concept that is regularly an event at Atta galatta was well received by all members as they enthusiastically participated and wrote letters on colourful sheets of paper. We then proceeded for the next project which was our ongoing PROJECT ECO BAG as they assisted us in donating over 500 eco-friendly bags to bakeries nearby. After a fun photo session, we zoomed or rather crawled through Bangalore traffic at a snail’s pace to drop them off with RC Jayanagar.

We then gathered for a reflective session where we all shared our experiences of being a small but an important part of those young one’s day. It was truly an enriching and humbling experience.

We also had a potluck where we shared food that we had either each prepared or (AHEM) bought. It is always fun to hang out and get to know the fun side of each of us at such projects. Members were also seen to lose some weight with some strenuous running. After a fancy photograph session we wound up on a very positive note.

Which was followed by a speech from our club member who spoke of how can Dr. S RadhaKrishna can be a role model to us. The Teachers of the school spoke which was inspiring and aimed at motivating kids to study and reach their goals. Then had a discussion on how we can help them out in terms of education for which we got a very good response. We, RCK promised them whatever help we can do from us will be done and we departed.
                
                - On the same day we organized a   joint International Project with RAC Sunrise RID 3150 & RC Banashankari RID 3190. The Project aimed at Felicitating teachers who go out of their way in making sure children get the best. We celebrated Teachers day at Samarthana School for the Disabled. The children, inspite of being disabled, showed us that they are no less and that anything is possible, all thanks to P.V. Srinivas Reddy, Sreenivasalu and Geetha K where each of them have had more than 13 years of experience with teaching and helping with the disabled. 
                
                - It is always heart-warming & fun and the special moments shared with these children will remain with us forever. As a contribution from us, Chocolates and notebooks were distributed to the school. Also helping them in whatever way we can truly made our day.

We also interacted with themaboutrotaract in their clubs, how they joined rotaract etc. We also hosted them with a free handwriting analysis session after which we played few games and got o know them better. Over all the whole day was superb and are gonna be cherished by each of us who attended it. IDYE hosting came to an end with a photo session of selfies.

                - Every day!! No matter to where you are travelling to in Bangalore. You just can’t avoid traffic. It’s like traffic is an integral part of Bangalore.
                
                - With this in mind, we at RCK thought may be at least if we follow traffic rules meant for Vehicles and pedestrians the traffic can be controlled. With a plan to bring in more traffic discipline among public we organised a traffic awareness campaign along with adugodi traffic police from 5pm to 7 pm. A heartfelt thank you to Adugodi traffic police for their support has to be mentioned.
                
                - When Rtr.Ravi and Rtr.Harish approached and proposed the project idea to Jayanagar Traffic police, the response we received back was huge. Such Support when we want to do a project only inspires us more and we got all materials ready for the big day. With a fear of how public will respond we moved on roads with banners and masks. It took only few seconds for us to get comfortable. The support of traffic police gave us a feeling of power, power to make things right.
                
                - Signal goes red and we hurry to the centre of road with banners stopping people from skipping the signal, asking people to move back from the zebra cross, telling people to wear helmets for their safety.
                
                - Altogether it was a great day. Thank you to Jayanagar Traffic police and to rotaractors from Jain College who joined us for the project. At the same time it was a pleasant surprise when Rotaractors from RCK who had went to Mysore the same day to attend a district programme joined us. After a tiring work out of around 2 and half hour we went back home after a small chat thanking all for the support and with pictures that showed the happiness each of us felt. Our Project was also posted on Bengaluru Traffic Police Facebook page. Along with that because of our interest and a good interaction with Jayanagar traffic police, we were invited to co-host one of their events in the coming days.

                - We had breakfast out of town and with games for entertainment, the energy was high. We reached  the famous TALAKADU at 10 AM. The Ancient and architecturally sound temples in the sand desert  took was to a different world.
                
                - The waters were waiting and we all were eager to jump in. Hence we finished our lunch together  and headed to the magnanimous and breathe taking GAGANA GHUKKI FALLS. No matter how tired  one feels the water always seems refreshing and even after a long walk of 5 kms, the happiness and  the energy to enjoy more was wonderful. We played in water without the realisation that it had  already been 4 hours since we got into water. 
                
                - It was a great time of enjoyment and also to understand each other better. We also had a great time  knowing our Guest Rotaractors Rtr Swapnil and Rtr Sayontanee from Mumbai and Kolkata

                - We thanked 34 ATM security guards for their amazing work. We had conversations with them, made them feel happy, and gave away edibles as a token of gratitude. 
                
                - Overall it was a great feeling to look at things from a different aspect. Carrying home the picture of smiling faces we all went our ways thinking what other things can be done.

                - Welcoming the New Year 2016 with a new spark, around 10 Rotaractors from our club went on a  trek trip to a little distant place called Yelagiri. The trip started at 12:00 am on January 1st 2016, we  celebrated new year at about 1:00 am with all staff at a petrol pump on the way by cutting a cake  (they welcomed us open heartedly and were surprised by our gesture).After a journey of 6 hours  (with a lot of tea breaks!!!) we reached this scenic and amazing place.
                
                - We learnt the trek would take 3 hrs one side from people around. It seemed they were bragging!!  After a while we realized this is going to be a long one, when we felt a bit tired. Nature dazzled us  with something to rejuvenate us. Every pause was motivating us to make it to the top wondering if  this very place is amazing how the top would be!!!
                
                - The view, the breeze, the chill, the mist and fog at the top made us forget all the strain and pain we  took to reach the summit. After spending 2 hours at the top we came down the series of hills for  another 2 hours.
                
                - Well we felt ecstatic about the trek. This one for sure is going to be in our memories for a very long  time to come.

Secondly to make citizens aware of their civic duty to cease spitting on the roads, and lastly to promote the activity of saving fuel. The automobile owners stopped and agreed to turn off their cars when requested to do so by the club members. The Rally could over all be said to be a success and hopefully a positive impact was made on the minds of those present, both the participants as well as the bystanders. The rally was for a duration of 3-4 hours and the members retired exhausted but with the glow of a job well done.

                - Daily hundreds of Stray dogs/animals die on highways due to our highspeed cars. Not many take the responsibility of the dead because it is not human. We took the initiative to spread awareness about the value of life and give them respect all living being deserve. 
                
                - We went on to the highways and looked around for any dead dog/animal who had met with an accident. On the first day (i.e., 4th Feb) of our initiative we buried two dead cats who met with road accidents. It was totally a difference experience for us and we decided to extend the initiative for the entire month. We spread awareness about the initiative across our District 3190.

                - We then started receiving multiple calls from various places in Bengaluru. Few were from Hennur, Kalyan Nagar, BTM etc. In rotation and based on the availability, Rotaractors were going to the spot for proper burial to the dogs/animals.
                
                - We also rescued few dogs during the course of our initiative and send them to the Dog shelter homes with proper arrangements made for them. 
                
                - Every time ensured that we are carrying Shovels, gloves, masks and all the required items are prescribed to us by Veterinary Doctor. Together it was a unique learning experience for all involved which made us realize the value of life..!!
